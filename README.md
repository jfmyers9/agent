# Agent Workflow Configuration

Harness-agnostic coding-agent workflow config with shared
instructions, rules, skills, and adapter-specific settings for Claude
Code, Pi, and Codex.

## Install

```sh
./install.sh claude   # install Claude Code adapter
./install.sh pi       # install Pi adapter
./install.sh codex    # install Codex adapter
./install.sh all      # install all adapters
```

Environment overrides:

- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — default `~/.claude`
- `PI_CONFIG_DIR` — default `~/.pi/agent`
- `CODEX_CONFIG_DIR` — default `~/.codex`
- `CODEX_AGENTS_DIR` — default `~/.agents`
- `BLUEPRINT_DIR` — default `~/workspace/blueprints`

## Prerequisites

- `git`
- Graphite CLI (`gt`) for stacked branch / PR workflow
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR and issue metadata
- Python 3 for Claude statusline only
- macOS Keychain only for Claude quota statusline enrichment
- Codex CLI (`codex`) for the Codex adapter

```

## Shared config

Portable across harnesses:

- `AGENTS.md` — global instructions
- `rules/*.md` — style, tests, comments, PR workflow, context budget
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` — Agent Skills-compatible workflow packages
- `bin/blueprint` — file-backed specs, plans, reviews, reports

Blueprints are the portable source of truth for long-lived state.
Research-backed proposals live in `spec/` and may include their own
`## Plan` execution section. Tactical fix/debug/PR plans live in
`plan/`:

```sh
blueprint create spec "topic"
blueprint create plan "fix or PR feedback topic"
blueprint create review "topic"
blueprint create report "topic"
blueprint find --type plan,spec,review
blueprint archive <slug>
```

## Claude Code adapter

Installed by `./install.sh claude` into `~/.claude`:

- links `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `rules/`, `skills/`
- links `harnesses/claude/settings.json` as `settings.json`
- links Claude statusline and hooks

Claude-specific features retained outside shared skills:

- Claude Code hooks and statusline protocol
- Claude plugin settings

Shared skills intentionally avoid native task/team paths and use
blueprints for durable workflow state in every harness.

## Pi adapter

Installed by `./install.sh pi` into `~/.pi/agent`:

- links `AGENTS.md`, `rules/`, `skills/`
- links `harnesses/pi/settings.json` as `settings.json`
- links Pi `keybindings.json`, `tui.json`, and `effort.json` when present
- links `harnesses/pi/extensions/*` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`
- installs `blueprint` to `~/.local/bin`

Pi uses `/skill:<name>` commands, for example:

```text
/skill:commit
/skill:submit
/skill:research
/skill:review
```

Direct aliases like `/commit` can be added later with a Pi extension.

## Codex adapter

Installed by `./install.sh codex` into `~/.codex` and `~/.agents`:

- links `harnesses/codex/config.toml` as `~/.codex/config.toml`
- links `harnesses/codex/hooks.json` and `harnesses/codex/hooks/*`
- links `AGENTS.md` and `rules/` into `~/.codex` as reference files
- links shared `skills/` as `$HOME/.agents/skills`
- links shared `rules/` as `$HOME/.agents/rules`
- installs `blueprint` to `~/.local/bin`

If `~/.codex/config.toml` already exists as a real file, the Codex
installer backs it up before linking the managed config.

Codex reads repository `AGENTS.md` files automatically. Shared skills are
installed through Codex's user skill path and can be invoked with
`$commit`, `$submit`, `$research`, `$review`, and other skill names.

## Portability status

Shared skills use blueprints for durable state and avoid native
Task/Team orchestration paths.

Blueprint-backed workflow skills:

- `research`, `implement`, `review`, `fix`, `vibe`
- `acceptance`, `split-commit`, `debug`, `respond`, `pr-plan`,
  `resume-work`, `report`, `archive`

Direct-action / utility skills:

- `commit`, `daily`, `gt`, `start`, `submit`, `refine`,
  `git-surgeon`, `writing-skills`

## Rules

- `rules/style.md` — simple readable code
- `rules/comment-quality.md` — comments explain what code cannot
- `rules/test-quality.md` — tests must catch realistic bugs
- `rules/pr-workflow.md` — Graphite-first PR workflow
- `rules/context-budget.md` — conserve context window
- `rules/skill-editing.md` — keep skills cohesive
- `rules/blueprints.md` — portable blueprint convention
- `rules/harness-compat.md` — portability rules for shared content
